## ⚙️ How It Works

1. A **Pandas DataFrame** is created to store four marketing outcomes along with their respective impact scores.
2. A **barplot** is generated using `seaborn`, displaying each outcome on the x-axis and its impact score on the y-axis.
3. **Annotations** are added above each bar to show exact impact scores, improving interpretability.
4. The result is a clean, presentation-ready chart showcasing the performance of each strategic outcome.
